## What is data deletion?

Data deletion is the process of removing personal information from a website or online service. This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as when a user requests that their data be deleted, when a user's account is deactivated or deleted, or when a website or online service is no longer in use.

Once you delete your data from a website, it is usually removed from the website's servers. However, it is important to note that your data may not be completely deleted immediately. In some cases, your data may be stored in backup or archive files for a period of time. Additionally, we may retain certain pieces of your data, such as your previous login details or other logs, for the purpose of preventing abuse and improving our site.
