## PURCHASES

The primary intention of developing WaveRD is to create an engaging blog that would cost users nothing. Wave Research has no intention of making this website paid — the service will remain free at all costs, amid constant improvement. Though we accept donations and incorporate Ads as a way to gain funds to keep our service running 24/7, WaveRD will never ask you to pay any amount to use any portion of our service at any time.

If you choose to purchase any product or service through Ads on this website, you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your purchase. WaveRD bears no responsibility or liability for your actions on any ad network and has no attachment to them.

## TERMINATION

We may terminate or suspend your access to our service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever — including if you breach these Terms of Use and Conditions. Provisions that should survive termination will remain in effect, including ownership, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

## CONTENT

Our Service allows you to post, link, store, share, and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics, videos, or other content, provided that you link back to the specific page on this website you are using. You are responsible for how you use this content.

## LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES

Our Service may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by WaveRD, including the ad network. WaveRD has no control over and assumes no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services.

You acknowledge and agree that WaveRD shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused by your use of or reliance on any third-party content, goods, or services.
