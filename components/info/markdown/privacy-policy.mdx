# Privacy Policy

WaveRD operates [https://www.waverd.com](https://www.waverd.com). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information we receive from users of the Site. We use your Personal Information only for the functionality of this site. By using the site, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Information Collection and Use

While using our Site, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to your name—which we don’t ask for—but your handle (nickname), as a way of reference to a particular manager.

## Data Collection

Some common personally identifiable information we collect and what we do with the data we receive:

- **Handle/Nickname**: A way for other managers/users and WaveRD to identify you.
- **Birthdate or Gender**: For the sake of privacy, we do not ask for either.
- **Email & Password**: It is proprietary that every account has a way to authenticate with our server. There's no better way to accomplish this than with the traditional email/password method, which is unique and used to identify/authorize/authenticate viewers.
- **Gender**: We'll never ask for your gender, nor will it be revealed to any user, since we don't have it.
- **Statistics**: We carry out statistical analysis with WaveRD.

We may use third-party services such as Google Analytics, Google Ads, Amazon Ads, etc., that may collect, monitor, and analyze this data.

## Social Provider

For a secure and reliable method to ensure account safety, we've implemented passwordless authentication (for sign-in purposes only) using either your **Facebook**, **Twitter**, or **Google** account. When we authenticate a user, we do not ask for any data other than your **email address**, which is used to check if an account already exists in our database.
